Matekarte
=========
Status
------
Unfortunately, matekarte.de is discontinued due to personal reasons. A successor is already established, which is found under [matemonkey.com](http://www.matemonkey.com). Currently, this project here is dead, but I will try to look into the [Matemonkey API](https://github.com/MateMonkey/api) to switch to this provider.

Description
-----------
Android client for [Matekarte](https://www.matekarte.de/), which lets you find
you locations of nearby dealers for Yerba Mate drinks like Club-Mate, Flora
Power, 1337MATE, and many more.

Special thanks to [Pascal](https://www.pascalj.de) for creating Matekarte.de and
the excellent API on this.
